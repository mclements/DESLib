# DESLib

Free library for Parallel DEVS and Process-Oriented Modeling in Modelica

## Library description

This library contains four packages that can be used to model discrete-event systems:

* `RandomLib` can be used to generate random numbers and variates, following continuous and discrete probability distributions.
* `DEVSLib` can be used to model discrete-event systems following the Parallel DEVS formalism.
* `SIMANLib` can be used to model discrete-event systems following the process-oriented approach. Its functionalities are equivalent to some of the functionalities of the SIMAN modeling language.
* `ARENALib` can be used to model discrete-event systems following the process-oriented approach. Its functionalities are equivalent to some of the functionalities of BasicProcess Panel in the Arena simulation environment.

The `DEVSLib`, `SIMANLib` and `ARENALib` libraries include interfaces to communicate with the rest of Modelica libraries, allowing to construct hybrid models.
